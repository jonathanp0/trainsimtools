# Jonathan's Zusi Tools

## Zusi 2 Browser & Journey Log
This tool, written in GO, is designed as a lightweight, local alternative to [Zusi Browser](http://zusi-info.steftones.de/).
Additionally, you can add the listed train services to a personal journey log, which is stored in JSON format.

### Download
Like all GO software it is compatible with Windows, MacOS and Linux, but a binary build is only available for Windows.
[Download latest version for Windows(released 24.12.15)](http://files.gu2.co.uk/zusi/zusibrowser.zip)

If you do not have Zusi installed in C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Zusi, you need to run it from the command line as
